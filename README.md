**Data source used (example):** data/mrr_quarterly.csv

## Executive Summary
The company’s average monthly recurring revenue (MRR) growth for 2024 quarters is **8.05**. The industry benchmark target is **15**. This indicates a clear shortfall versus competitor/industry expectations and requires strategic initiatives to accelerate growth.

## Data & Key Findings
- Quarterly values:
  - Q1: 6.73
  - Q2: 10.05
  - Q3: 5.42
  - Q4: 10.00
- **Computed average MRR growth:** **8.05**
- Trend: growth is inconsistent with two stronger quarters (Q2, Q4) and two weak quarters (Q1, Q3). Volatility suggests product-market fit and go-to-market inconsistency.
- The company is ~6.95 percentage points below the industry target of 15.

## Business Implications
- Slower revenue growth threatens ability to invest in product & sales capacity and may reduce valuation multiples at the next funding or reporting period.
- Volatility across quarters suggests either seasonal demand effects or inconsistent acquisition/retention efforts.
- Competitors meeting the 15% target likely have clearer segment fit and higher-converting acquisition channels.

## Recommendation (Actionable) — **Expand into new market segments**
To reach the 15% benchmark, prioritize:
1. **Targeted segment expansion**: Identify 1–2 high-ARPU segments adjacent to current customers (e.g., industry verticals, larger enterprise tiers).
2. **Dedicated GTM experiments**: Run short 12-week go-to-market experiments per segment (tailored landing pages, targeted ads, sales outreach, custom onboarding).
3. **Product packaging**: Create vertical-specific packages and pricing that simplify purchase decisions for the new segment.
4. **Sales & success resources**: Assign a small SDR + Customer Success pilot team to validate expansion and accelerate initial closed-won deals.
5. **Measure and iterate**: Use cohort-level metrics (CAC, LTV, conversion rate) from these pilots to forecast trajectory toward 15%.

These combined actions are expected to increase average MRR growth by improving conversion and ARPU from new segments.
